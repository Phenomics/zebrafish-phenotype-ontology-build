There are many phenotype ontologies available. For instance the Human Phenotype Ontology is intended to provide a structured vocabulary of phenotypic abnormalities due to Human disease. Terms of phenotype ontologies can be associated to individuals, OMIM diseases, genes, SNPs, etc., depending on the resolution of available data and application. In contrast to the precomposition approach, in which terms are explicitly created like in the Human Phenotype Ontology, the zebrafish community describes phenotypes of zebrafish genes using a strict pattern of terms originating from low-level ontologies.

In order to allow existing algorithm and tools (semantic similarity, enrichment, etc.) to take advantage of this data as well, it is useful to separate the phenotypic concepts from the actual annotations. This project is an attempt in doing so.
